# Egg Timer

## Overview

Welcome to the Egg Timer app project! This app helps you boil eggs to perfection based on your preferred doneness level. It's a practical introduction to Swift programming, focusing on timer management, UI updates with progress views, and using conditional statements for logic control.

## Features

- Select your desired egg hardness (soft, medium, or hard).
- Start the countdown timer for the selected egg hardness.
- Visual progress with a progress view indicating the remaining time.
- Alert notification when the eggs are ready.

## Learning Goals

- **Swift Collections:** Utilize dictionaries to store and retrieve egg boiling times based on hardness levels.
- **Timer API:** Implement countdown functionality using Swiftâ€™s Timer API.
- **Conditional Statements:** Use if-else and switch statements to manage different egg hardness options.
- **Functions with Outputs:** Define functions to calculate and return egg boiling times based on selected hardness.
- **UI Development:** Integrate progress views to display the remaining countdown time visually.

## What I Learned

- Implemented timer functionality to countdown and update UI dynamically.
- Utilized Swift dictionaries to store and retrieve data efficiently.
- Applied conditional statements for logic branching based on user input.
- Enhanced understanding of progress views for visual feedback.
- Explored Swift's Timer API for time-based operations in iOS apps.

## Usage

1. **Select Egg Hardness:**
   - Choose from soft, medium, or hard options.

2. **Start Timer:**
   - Press the "Start" button to begin the countdown.

3. **View Progress:**
   - Watch the progress view fill as the timer counts down.

4. **Get Alert:**
   - Receive a notification when your eggs are ready.

## Code Overview

### Models

- **EggTimer.swift:** Manages the timer logic and stores egg boiling times.

### View Controllers

- **ViewController.swift:** Handles user interface and interactions.
