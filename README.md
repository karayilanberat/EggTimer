# Egg Timer

# Overview

Welcome to the Egg Timer app project! This app helps you boil eggs to perfection based on your preferred doneness level. 
It's a practical introduction to Swift programming, focusing on timer management, UI updates with progress views, and using conditional statements for logic control.

# Features

- Select your desired egg hardness (soft, medium, or hard).
- Start the countdown timer for the selected egg hardness.
- Visual progress with a progress view indicating the remaining time.
- Alert notification when the eggs are ready.

# Learning Goals

- Swift Collections: Utilize dictionaries to store and retrieve egg boiling times based on hardness levels.
- Timer API: Implement countdown functionality using Swiftâ€™s Timer API.
- Conditional Statements: Use if-else and switch statements to manage different egg hardness options.
- Functions with Outputs: Define functions to calculate and return egg boiling times based on selected hardness.
- UI Development: Integrate progress views to display the remaining countdown time visually.

# What I Learned

- Implemented timer functionality to countdown and update UI dynamically.
- Utilized Swift dictionaries to store and retrieve data efficiently.
- Applied conditional statements for logic branching based on user input.
- Enhanced understanding of progress views for visual feedback.
- Explored Swift's Timer API for time-based operations in iOS apps.
